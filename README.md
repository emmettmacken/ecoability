Premise: People with disabilities are more impacted by climate change than well-abled people, a very timely example of this is the fires in LA. If you're surrounded by fire, you or I can run or make some attempt to escape. If you're in a wheelchair, your odds of survival are far lower than that of a well-abled individual. So, the idea of the whole platform, EcoAbility.eu, is that companies that operate within the green environment, produce green outputs, whether it be green tech - such as solar panels, or something grown in an eco-friendly manner, and if they work with, employ or support individuals with disabilities, they gain access to our website, where they can sell their goods.

-Would not hold any stock, would act like an intermediary. If a product is ordered, we would take the order details and payment, send the order details to the company, that company would ship it out, the same as a regular online sale, and then at the end of every month we would send them the sales figure minus our commission. Up-Front cash business.

Requirements for companies

-Employ individuals with disabilities OR support disability charities (like Enable Ireland) OR produce goods tailored to individuals with disabilities (e.g. Primark Adaptive Fashion launching end of January in 96 stores across 10 countries)

-Use the company's local webpage to prevent goods being shipped across the globe, increasing the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere.

e.g. ecoability.eu/ie - Ireland

Ecoability.eu/fr - France

Ecoability.eu/de - Germany

Ecoability.eu/es -Spain

Scaling (URL helps with scalability also)

-Could franchise it out to a local company and run it locally and charge them a commission

OR

-Physically grow the company and the business in each place and keep it in house

OR

-License it to a company, for example, in Germany, and have a 2% processing fee, so they could set their fee at 10%, and 2% of that goes to us.

Digital and Physical Stamp

-Down the line, we will create a stamp which we will give to the companies on our webpage that they may display on their webpages or packaging which shows that they are ecofriendly and employ people with disabilities, a bit like Guaranteed Irish.

Ourselves

-The company itself would employ people with disabilities for customer service, web development, infrastructure

The company in short

EcoAbility will employ people with disabilities and work with companies involved in the green economy who employ people with disabilities.
